This is a list of files from my Tomodachi Collection translation I will be updating.

These files are the dialog sections, not the game itself. If you want to compile a rom from source, You'll need [Tinke](https://github.com/pleonex/tinke/releases/tag/v0.9.2).
Once I have a finished ROM, I'll upload an IPS in releases, you can use multiple tools to patch a rom.

I will not provide a Tomodachi Collection DS Rom, I will never provide this.
Hope this project does well!
